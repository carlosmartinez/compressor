#Compressor code test

Just some code I wrote for a code test a while back. 

##Instructions

- Implement two methods to perform basic string compression/decompression
- e.g. aaabbccc will compress to a3b2c3 and vice-versa. 
- You can assume the input is only letters. 
- If the compressed string did not become smaller then return the original string.  
- Provide some tests to cover these methods. Another example; a11b1 would become aaaaaaaaaaab.

##Notes

- The code and the tests aren't even in separate files. Outrageous! Hey, it's a code test.
